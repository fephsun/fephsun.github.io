I currently work for <a href="http://waymo.com" target="_blank">Waymo</a>, Google's self-driving car project.  I do machine learning for behavior prediction - my team's job is to anticipate what other cars and pedestrians will be doing 5 seconds from now, in real time.  Before then, I was 6-2 (electrical engineering and computer science) at MIT, class of 2015.  I stayed for an MEng with Jim Glass's <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/sls/" target="_blank">Spoken Language Systems</a> group, working on multimodal speech recognition.

If you have any questions, or if you just want to discuss something (admissions?  math?), feel free to email me at felixsun@google.com (work) or fephsun@gmail.com (personal).
