MATHCOUNTS Resources
</h1>

<p>
Here are some resources for competitive math at the middle school level.  They are listed
from the most common to the most obscure, so if you're a beginner, try the first few.  If you've burned through all of the
material you've seen so far, try the links near the bottom.  I guarantee that you'll find something new.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://mathcounts.org" target="_blank"> The MATHCOUNTS Webpage </a></b><br />
MATHCOUNTS is <i>the</i> middle school math competition in the U.S.
Most middle schools have a team or club, which competes at regional, state, and national levels.  On the website are problems from
last year, a Problem of the Week program, and information about purchasing contest books, as well as directions for participating in the competition.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://amc.maa.org/index.shtml" target="_blank"> The American Mathematics Competitions</a></b><br />
The AMC is a major middle and high school math contest.  Most middle school students will take the AMC 8, a 40-minute
test with 25 multiple choice questions.  More experienced students may take the AMC 10 or 12, which are technically high school
contests.  All AMCs qualify into higher level contests: the AMC 8 into the AMC 10, amd the AMC 10/12 into the American Invitational
Mathematics Examination (AIME).
<br /><br />
This official website has directions for participation and a store selling past contests.  However, you can visit the
<a href="http://amc.maa.org/mathclub/5,0-problems.shtml" target="_blank"> Math Club Resources Page</a> to access these problems
for free!
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://artofproblemsolving.com" target="_blank"> Art of Problem Solving</a></b><br />
Art of Problem Solving, sometimes abbreviated AoPS, is the main online gathering place for middle and high school students seriously
interested in math.  It contains a forum that is buzzing with talk about hard math problems, math concepts, and the latest contests.
There is also an archive of old AMC and AIME problems, complete with solutions.  AoPS offers online math classes, which cover
challenging variations on classroom material, as well as math not traditionally taught in school, like number theory and combinatorics.
(Disclaimer: I grade papers for these classes.)  Some of the textbooks can be bought and worked on independently.
In addition, the website has "For the Win!", a game like the MATHCOUNTS countdown round, played against real opponents.

<b><a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/" target ="_blank">Cut the Knot</a></b><br />
For coaches and curious students, Cut the Knot has many math lessons and articles.  Especially interesting are the Java-powered math
animations.  It's easy to blow an hour or two just reading the site and exploring.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://mathcounts.saab.org/mc.cgi" target ="_blank">Saab MATHCOUNTS Drills</a></b><br />
This website contains many MATHCOUNTS problems, sorted by subject.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://purplecomet.org/" target="_blank">Purple Comet Math Meet</a></b></br>
Purple Comet is an online math contest for middle and high school students.  The website has a large problem archive.  Also, consider
signing up your MATHCOUNTS team for this contest in addition to the standard MATHCOUNTS competition.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://geomath.do.am/_fr/0/main_problem_fi.pdf" target="_blank">Problem of the Day</a></b><br />
This PDF contains 95 challenging problems, good for advanced students.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://sch.ci.lexington.ma.us/~jfrost/MC/" target="_blank"> MATHCOUNTS Handbook Archive</a></b><br />
This page, maintained by a math teacher in Massachusetts, hosts old MATHCOUNTS handbooks.  Each handbook contains hundreds of problems
similar to the ones in competition.  They are split into "Warm-Ups" (calculator-free) and "Workouts" (calculators allowed).
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://nrich.maths.org/public/" target="_blank"> NRICH </a></b><br />
NRICH is a British project and magazine focused on math education enrichment.  Each free issue has interesting math mini-lessons and
challenges.  These topics are good for stimuating discussion and group work.  Difficulty ranges from elementary school to high school levels.
The archives go back over 100 issues.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.mathpickle.com/K-12/Videos_7-9.html" target="_blank">MathPickle</a></b><br />
MathPickle has videos that will give teachers and coaches great lesson ideas.  There's also an interesting "Million
Dollar Problem" section featuring unsolved, but accessible, math problems.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.ukmt.org.uk/" target="_blank">United Kingdom Mathematics Trust</a></b><br />
The UKMT runs the British math olympiads for middle and high school.  The website has past contests and solutions.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://activities.tjhsst.edu/vmt/" target="_blank">TJ Varsity Math Team</a></b><br />
The Thomas Jefferson HS Math Team has placed in multiple nationwide contests.  Its website shares lectures and notes by senior members of the
team.  While this is aimed at high school students (and good ones, at that), there are some good, accessible articles.  If you are overwhelmed,
scan for the word "beginner" in the topics.

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.blaine.wednet.edu/mathchamps/math_champs.html" target="_blank">Blaine Math Championships (Washington State)</a></b><br />
This is a regional contest with solid problems.  Look for old contests.
