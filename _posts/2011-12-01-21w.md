21W.033 Portfolio
=================

This is a collection of stuff I did for MIT's 21W.033, a writing / engineering class taught by the immortal Dave Custer.

<h3> Solar Water Heater Project</h3>

<p>
For our second project, we worked in small groups to create solar water heaters.  Our team's design heats 100ml of water using a parabolic concentrator.  It was inspired by <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-build-a-strikeheliostatstrike-paraboli/">this Instructables project</a>. Curious?

<h3> ESG Elevator Accelerator </h3>
<p>
In the third and final project, our group attacked a problem that frustrates many ESG students and staff: the slow elevator.  ESG is on the 6th floor of Building 24, which is served by only one elevator.  To reduce the elevator wait time, we designed and built a device to remotely call the elevator from the ESG lounge.  We also created a system to display the elevator's current position in the ESG lounge, so users can wait in the lounge instead of in the hall.
