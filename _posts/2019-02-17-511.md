title: Caltrain predictor
---

This little webpage is designed to fix a single problem with Caltrain: the
predicted arrival times suck for late trains.  Caltrain optimistically predicts
that late trains will catch up to the timetable at the rate of several minutes
per stop.  In reality, late trains stay the same lateness.

So, this webpage takes Caltrain's predicted train arrival times, and updates
them to be less optimistic.

The page requires the last 4 characters of an API key.  These characters are 
"eb0b".
